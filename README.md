# HousePricePridiction

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict house prices accurately. The insights derived from this project could be beneficial for various stakeholders, including home buyers, real estate developers, and policy-makers, by providing them with a data-driven tool to estimate house prices.

## Project Overview

Predicting house prices is a fundamental task in the real estate industry. The price of a house depends on various factors such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other features. By using machine learning algorithms, we can develop a model that predicts house prices based on historical data. This can help stakeholders make more informed decisions, optimize pricing strategies, and assess market trends.

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various input features.
- Evaluate the performance of multiple models and choose the best-performing one.
- Analyze the dataset to understand the most significant features affecting house prices.
- Provide a tool that can be used by real estate professionals, investors, and potential buyers to estimate property values.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (price).
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may help improve the modelâ€™s performance (e.g., interaction terms, logarithmic transformations).
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Test various machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict house prices. Evaluate these models based on metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the performance of the chosen model through techniques such as grid search or random search.
